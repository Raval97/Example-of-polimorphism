# Example-of-polimorphism
Project showing graphic use of polymorphism in C ++.

The program creates Shape class objects, respectively a triangle, a circle, a parallelogram, and ComplexShape.

The Shape class uses the Display class, from which the inheritance of classes suitable 
for display in descriptive and graphic form is inherited.

GraphicalDisplay draws shapes using the parameters which are two vectors for the triangle and the parallelogram 
and the radius for the circle

The project was created as credits for classes in Programming Methods.
